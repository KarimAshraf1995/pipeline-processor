Hazard unit wiring changed check diagram
---------------------------------
//I will define first some signals from the input to make things easy to understand
iR1 = 3-5 of instruction memory output
iR2 = 6-8 of instruction memory output
bR2 = 6-8 of fetch buffer
bOp = 0-2 of fetch buffer 

if WB == 10
&& iR1 == bR2
&& iR2 == bR2
&& bOp != 100 
pc enable - hu = 0 (else it should be = 1)
flush lower bits of fetch buffer (but stall overrides this case I just don't want to make the new instruction enter)
